# Lottery Scheduler

## Overview
For this project, we were tasked with implementing a **Lottery Scheduler** within the xv6 operating system. Lottery scheduling is a probabilistic CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a number of lottery tickets. The CPU is then allocated to processes based on a random lottery draw, where the chances of a process being selected are proportional to the number of tickets it holds.

## Features
- Fair scheduling based on a random lottery system.
- Allows for varying priorities by assigning different amounts of tickets to processes.
- Demonstrates the behavior of a lottery scheduler in a controlled operating system environment.

## How It Works
1. Each process is given a certain number of lottery tickets.
2. The scheduler randomly draws a ticket, and the process holding the winning ticket gets to run.
3. Processes with more tickets have a higher probability of being selected, while processes with fewer tickets have a lower probability.

### Example
- Process A has 10 tickets.
- Process B has 20 tickets.
- Process C has 5 tickets.

In this case, Process B has the highest chance of winning the lottery and getting CPU time, while Process C has the lowest.

## Screenshots

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lottery-scheduler.git
    ```

2. Compile the xv6 OS and your scheduler modifications:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

3. Run xv6 with the scheduler:
    ```bash
    ./xv6
    ```

4. Test the lottery scheduler by executing the test program:
    ```bash
    schTest
    ```

## Project Details
This project is part of a course assignment for operating systems at my university and was developed as a custom CPU scheduling algorithm for the xv6 operating system.

The lottery scheduler is designed to demonstrate probabilistic scheduling methods in a simulated environment, offering insight into process management and scheduling algorithms. While this project is based on the xv6 OS, it serves as an educational tool rather than a production-level implementation.

# The Initial ReadMe and Full Acknowlgements for xv6:

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)).  See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/, which provides
pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu).  The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.1810, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
